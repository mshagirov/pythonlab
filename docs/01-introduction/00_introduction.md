# Python Introduction

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a general-purpose programming language
used for a wide range of domains. In addition to its versatility,
Python's intuitive syntax is relatively easy to read, and makes it perfect for
beginners as well as efficient for experienced code maintainers. For instance,
you can read and understand following python code as if it is written in "plain
English" (if you ignore the parentheses),

```python
print("Hello there")
print("General Kenobi")
```

These, as you might have guessed, just print two lines,

```sh
Hello there
General Kenobi
```

`print` here is a Python command, or more correctly a function, that takes its
input which is everything between following `(` and `)` and outputs it to the
*console*.

> Console in programming refers to any interface for interacting with a computer
program. Console is usually text based interface, like a terminal application.
All executable code and their output fields on this site are also an example of
console.

Due to Python's wide adoption, Python boasts a vast ecosystem of
libraries, frameworks, and packages that extend its capabilities for diverse
tasks. These tasks or domains include, but not limited to,

- Server-side web development,
- Automation (scripting),
- Machine learning,
- Data analysis,
- "Scientific computing".

This workshop session will mainly focus on the Python language and its features.
The following sessions will follow up with the applications of Python using the
*science stack*.

> Science stack is a loosely defined term for a collection of packages
and libraries generally used for scientific computing. We will learn more about
science stack after we learn basic Python and practice writing some Python code.
