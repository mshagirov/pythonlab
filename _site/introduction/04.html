The value of a variable represents a specific type of data such as a number or a text. It is very simple to define a varible in Python, all you need is to assign a value to the variable with =. variable_name = value variable_name: Variable name can be any alphanumeric sequence of characters that starts with a letter or an underscore _, e.g., abc, ABC123, _abc123. value: Value can be any value with a built-in or valid user defined type, where the type refers to the type of the data stored in the memory, e.g., a text. For example, the following defines a variable username, uses it in a f-string, and prints the result. Here, the variable username refers to a string Kenobi. Name Value username &quot;Kenobi&quot; You can also define multiple variables on a single line. Don’t overuse this feature. It might be hard to read code with &gt;2-3 variables defined on a single line, especially when you have long variable names. The future you will thank you if you write a code that is easier to read. Naming Variables By convention, Python programmers use snake case when naming their variables. In snake case, characters are written in lower case and for multi-word names, the words are separated by underscore _. E.g., user_id, circle_diameter, etc. This is a not enforced by the Python interpreter but it is a preferred convention for code readability. You may stray away from this convention in some cases. For instance, to include units of measurement, e.g., force_N doesn’t use snake case as it contains an upper case character. Be careful to NOT name your variables int, float, string or any other Python key words. This will override the default objects’ names and will lead to bugs in your code. Unfortunately, Python interpreter does not enforce this as a rule and you just have to remember to not use these as variable names. For instance, int=&quot;integer&quot;, str=2, or float=3.14 are valid syntax for defining variables. Try it for yourself, by defining some “forbidden variables” in the above cell and print them out, Python will happily run the code for you. Updating Variable’s Value To update or change the value of a variable, you simply assign it a new value. Types Computer stores everything in its memory as a binary data composed of zeros and ones. The type of the data determines what these zeros and ones actually represent. The Python standard library comes with a wide range of built-in types that you can use to represent your data. We have already seen the following: int: Signed integers, e.g., -423, 0, 12897. Python automatically adjusts the size of an int in the memory (number of bytes) depending on the value of the integer. float: Floats or floating-point numbers are a subset of real numbers that can be approximated with binary fractions. They are stored as 64-bit or double precision numbers in most Python implementations. str: Strings in Python represent textual data. E.g., &quot;Kenobi&quot;, &quot;Hello there!&quot;. Name Value Type username &quot;Kenobi&quot; str x 2 int y 3.14 float Additionally, Python also implements types for working with bytes, dates and times, and sequences. We will learn about more complex types such as sequences in the following sections. For a complete list of data types in Python refer to the official documentation. Boolean Type Another frequently used type in Python is a bool. bool : Boolean type has two possible values True and False that represent truth values. To get a logical complement of a bool variable use the not operator. We will use bool when doing logical operations and writing conditional statements (if-else statements). When used with mathematical operations, Python implicitly casts bool to int or float and treats it as a number, True is 1, and False is 0. None Type In Python, NoneType represents a null or absence of a value. NoneType only has a single value None. Compared to other programming langugages, None in Python is a distinct object and doesn’t represent zero value, e.g., these are NOT null in Python, an empty string &quot;&quot;, numerical 0, etc. Also, note that str &quot;None&quot; is not the same as None. When you print the None and a string &quot;None&quot; they appear to be the same. To determine if the variable is NoneType or just a string you can use the following: repr function Use is or == to compare the value with actual None: Or use one of the type checking methods in the next section, e.g., type or isinstance. Determining and Verifying Types You can determine the type of a varible using type() method. type(object) takes in an object, variable or value, and returns the type of the object, int, str etc. You can further compare the value of the type obtained from this function with an actual target type using is and ==. Alternatively, you can also use isinstance to verify type of a given variable instead of a comparison. isinstance(object, type) takes in the object and a type, and returns a bool value. True if the types match and False otherwise. Type Casting Type casting in programming means converting one type to another. For example, when you do mathematical operations on variables with float and int types, the interpreter implicitly type casts int to float (the result will have decimal .). The decimal point . is used to define a float. E.g., 2. is a float equal to 2.0. Using division / always produces float, and floor division \\ produces int unless one of the numbers is a float. Sometimes you may want to explicitly convert one type to another. For instance, int to a str, or float to int etc. For this you may use Python’s type casting methods to convert between types. int(object) : convert any compatible object to int. float(object): convert a compatible object to float. str(object): convert any object to its string representation. Note that when casting higher precision type float to a lower precision type int data loss may occur. Also, some values might not be compatible for type conversion, e.g., non-numeric string to a numeric int or float. Below is another example that uses type casting with int() and float() methods. The last two lines convert an int object with value x + y to a float and print it. Dynamic Typing Python is a dynamically typed language where Python automatically infers a variable’s type when you run the code. This leads to less boilerplate code when defining variables and functions, and allows quicker prototyping. The dynamic typing comes at a cost as a lower performance (slower running code), and potentially runtime type errors. The performance hit is due to type checking of the variables by the interpreter during the runtime which takes up the CPU time. We have to accept it as a cost for convenience. On the other hand, the effect of the type errors can be minimised. For instance, if your code expects a certain type of data and you accidentally change the type of a variable, the interpreter will not be aware of the error until you run the code. E.g., the following might lead to runtime type errors: delta_t = 1 ... delta_t = &quot;one hour&quot; You can avoid this by creating a new type of variable instead of overriding the old value and its type. delta_t = 1 ... delta_t_info = &quot;one hour&quot; Exercises E1: Calculate Sum and Average Complete the following code so that it computes and prints a sum and average of the numbers x1, x2, x3, and x4.

    <h3 id="variable">Variable</h3>

<p><em>Variable</em> in programming represents a named location in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory" target="_blank">memory</a>
that stores a value. The value of a variable represents a specific type of
data such as a number or a text.</p>

<p>It is very simple to define a varible in Python, all you need is to <em>assign</em> a
value to the variable with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">variable_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">variable_name</code>: <em>Variable name</em> can be any alphanumeric sequence of characters
that starts with a letter or an underscore <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_</code>, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abc</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABC123</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_abc123</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code>: <em>Value</em> can be any value with a built-in or valid user defined <em>type</em>,
where the type refers to the type of the data stored in the memory, e.g., a text.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the following defines a variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code>, uses it in a f-string,
and prints the result.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
username = "Kenobi"
print(f"General {username}!")
</script></pre></div>

<p>Here, the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code> refers to a string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kenobi</code>.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Name</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Kenobi"</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can also define multiple variables on a single line.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
x, y = 2, 3.14

print(f"x: {x}")
print(f"y: {y}")
</script></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t overuse this feature. It might be hard to read code with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;2-3</code> variables
defined on a single line, especially when you have long variable names. The
future you will thank you if you write a code that is easier to read.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="naming-variables">Naming Variables</h3>

<p>By convention, Python programmers use <em>snake case</em> when naming their variables.
In snake case, characters are written in lower case and for multi-word names, the
words are separated by underscore <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_</code>.
E.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_id</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">circle_diameter</code>, etc. This is a not enforced by the Python
interpreter but it is a preferred convention for code readability.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
user_id = "Ripley"
print(f"{user_id} is logged-in.")
</script></pre></div>

<p>You may stray away from this convention in some cases. For
instance, to include units of measurement, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">force_N</code> doesn’t use snake
case as it contains an upper case character.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
force_N = 0.21
area_m2 = 0.05

stress_Pa = force_N / area_m2
print(f"Stress (Pa): {stress_Pa}")
</script></pre></div>

<p>Be careful to NOT name your variables <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string</code> or any other
Python <em>key words</em>. This will override the default objects’ names and will lead to
bugs in your code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, Python interpreter does not enforce this as a
rule and you just have to remember to not use these as variable names.
For instance, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int="integer"</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str=2</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float=3.14</code> are valid syntax for
defining variables. Try it for yourself, by defining some “forbidden variables”
in the above cell and print them out, Python will happily run the code for you.</p>

<h3 id="updating-variables-value">Updating Variable’s Value</h3>

<p>To update or change the value of a variable, you simply assign it a new value.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
length = 42
print("old value:", length)

length = 1
print("new value:", length)
</script></pre></div>

<h3 id="types">Types</h3>

<p>Computer stores everything in its memory as a binary data composed of zeros and
ones. The <em>type</em> of the data determines what these zeros and ones actually represent.
The Python standard library comes with a wide range of built-in types that you
can use to represent your data.</p>

<p>We have already seen the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code>: Signed integers, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-423</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">12897</code>. Python automatically adjusts
the size of an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> in the memory (number of bytes) depending on the value of
the integer.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code>: Floats or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic" target="_blank">floating-point numbers</a>
are a subset of real numbers that can be approximated with binary fractions. They
are stored as 64-bit or <em>double precision</em> numbers in most Python implementations.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code>: Strings in Python represent textual data. E.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Kenobi"</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Hello there!"</code>.</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Name</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Value</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Kenobi"</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.14</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Additionally, Python also implements types for working with bytes, dates and
times, and sequences. We will learn about more complex types such as sequences
in the following sections. For a complete list of data types in Python refer
to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#built-in-types" target="_blank">the official documentation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="boolean-type">Boolean Type</h3>

<p>Another frequently used type in Python is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code> : <em>Boolean</em> type has two possible values <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code> that represent
truth values.</li>
  <li>To get a <em>logical complement</em> of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code> variable use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">not</code> operator.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code> when doing logical operations and writing conditional statements
(<em>if-else</em> statements).</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
is_mutant = True
likes_pizza = not False

print("Mutant turtle:", is_mutant)
print("Likes pizza:", likes_pizza)
</script></pre></div>

<p>When used with mathematical operations, Python implicitly
casts <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code> and treats it as a number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> is 1, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code> is 0.</p>

<h3 id="none-type">None Type</h3>

<p>In Python, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NoneType</code> represents a null or absence of a value. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NoneType</code> only has
a single value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code>. Compared to other programming langugages, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code> in Python
is a distinct object and doesn’t represent zero value, e.g., these are NOT null in
Python, an empty string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">""</code>, numerical <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>, etc. Also, note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"None"</code>
is not the same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
n, s = None, "None"
print(n, "(NoneType)")
print(s, "(str)")
</script></pre></div>

<p>When you print the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code> and a string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"None"</code> they appear to be the same. To
determine if the variable is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NoneType</code> or just a string you can use the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repr</code> function</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
n, s = None, "None"
print(repr(n), "(NoneType)")
print(repr(s), "(str)")
</script></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code> to compare the value with actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code>:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
n, s = None, "None"
print(n is None, "(NoneType)")
print(s is None, "(str)")
</script></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>Or use one of the type checking methods in the next section, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isinstance</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="determining-and-verifying-types">Determining and Verifying Types</h3>

<p>You can determine the type of a varible using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type()</code> method.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type(object)</code> takes in an object, variable or value, and returns the type of
the object, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code> etc. You can further compare the value of the type
obtained from this function with an actual target type using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
x = 42
print(f"Is {x} int? {type(x) is int}")
print(f"Is {x} float? {type(x) is float}")
</script></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isinstance</code> to verify type of a given variable
instead of a comparison.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isinstance(object, type)</code> takes in the object and a type, and returns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bool</code>
value. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> if the types match and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code> otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
x = 42
print(f"Is {x} int?", isinstance(x, int))
</script></pre></div>

<h3 id="type-casting">Type Casting</h3>

<p>Type casting in programming means converting one type to another. For example,
when you do mathematical operations on variables with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> types,
the interpreter implicitly <em>type casts</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code> (the result will have
decimal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code>).</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
x = 2
print(x + 2)
print(x + 2.)
</script></pre></div>

<p>The decimal point <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> is used to define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code>. E.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.</code> is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code> equal
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.0</code>. Using division <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> always produces <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code>, and floor division <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\\</code>
produces <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> unless one of the numbers is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
x, y = 6, 3

print(x / y)
print(x // y)
print(x // 3.)
</script></pre></div>

<p>Sometimes you may want to <em>explicitly</em> convert one type to another. For instance,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> etc. For this you may use Python’s type
casting <em>methods</em> to convert between types.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int(object)</code> : convert any compatible object to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float(object)</code>: convert a compatible object to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str(object)</code>: convert any object to its string representation.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that when casting higher precision type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code> to a lower precision type
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> data loss may occur. Also, some values might not be compatible for type
conversion, e.g.,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" target="_blank">non-numeric string to a numeric <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code></a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
my_number = 4.2
text = "My number is " + str(my_number)
print(text)
</script></pre></div>

<p>Below is another example that uses type casting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float()</code> methods.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker="">
x = int(3.14)
print(x, type(x))

y = int(" 2 ")
print(y, type(y))

z = float(x + y)
print(z, type(z))
</script></pre></div>

<p>The last two lines convert an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> object with value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x + y</code> to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code> and
print it.</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-typing">Dynamic Typing</h3>

<p>Python is a <strong>dynamically typed</strong> language where Python automatically infers a
variable’s type when you run the code. This leads to less boilerplate code when
defining variables and functions, and allows quicker prototyping. The dynamic
typing comes at a cost as a lower performance (slower running code),
and potentially runtime type errors.</p>

<p>The performance hit is due to type checking of the variables by the interpreter
during the runtime which takes up the CPU time. We have to accept it as a cost for
convenience.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the effect of the type errors can be minimised. For instance,
if your code expects a certain type of data and you accidentally change the type
of a variable, the interpreter will not be aware of the error until you run the
code. E.g., the following might lead to runtime type errors:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">delta_t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="bp">...</span>
<span class="n">delta_t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">one hour</span><span class="sh">"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can avoid this by creating a new type of variable instead of overriding the
old value and its type.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">delta_t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="bp">...</span>
<span class="n">delta_t_info</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">one hour</span><span class="sh">"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
