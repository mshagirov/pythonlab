### Exceptions

Errors happen. Good to know error types, also helps with debugging. Exceptions
and try-except

Raising custom exceptions with `raise`

<div class="prevnextlinks">
    <a id="previous" href="11">Previous: Useful Tools</a>
    <a id="next" href="13">Next: Conclusion</a>
</div>
<script src="{{ '/assets/js/navigation.js' | relative_url }}" defer></script>
