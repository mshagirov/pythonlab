### Variables

- updating/mutating variables (this is why it's called a variable)
- assignment: storing values
- naming variables: "snake_case", words are lowercase and separated by underscores

### Data Types

- variable types: string, integer, float, boolean
- "type()" command
- None type
- Dynamic Typing: be carefull and updating values.
- Strings :
  - F-Strings examples
  - string concatination
- multivariable declaration/assignment

Exercise by computing mean (int/float), concat and format (strings/numbers),
examining variable types and updating variables (int, float, string, None,
boolean).
