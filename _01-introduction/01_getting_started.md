## Language

Language:

- What is syntax?
- Python syntax: basic arithmetics, strings, printing instructions.
- Sequence of commands (serial execution).
- Syntax errors (will be helpful with debugging). Demo.
- Logical errors (unexpected behaviour)
- comments

### Variables

- updating/mutating variables (this is why it's called a variable)
- assignment: storing values
- naming variables: "snake_case", words are lowercase and separated by underscores

### Data Types

- variable types: string, integer, float, boolean
- "type()" command
- None type
- Dynamic Typing: be carefull and updating values.
- Strings :
  - F-Strings examples
  - string concatination
- multivariable declaration/assignment

Exercise by computing mean (int/float), concat and format (strings/numbers),
examining variable types and updating variables (int, float, string, None,
boolean).  

### Functions (basic) & Identation in Python

### Multiparameter Functions

### Return and Return None

E.g. when printing

### Declaration and Usage Sequence

Variable and func: declare before using/calling.

### Returning Multiple Values

### Default values for func args
