## Python Syntax

Syntax in programming refers to the *grammar rule* of the programming language.
The syntax, just like in human-languages, determines how the code it structures
and used. I believe it is easier to learn the Python and its syntax by
trying and breaking it instead of reading the syntax documentation.

## Basic Arithmetics

For example, let's start with basic arithmetics with two numbers `a` and `b`. To
do basic arithmetics Python uses the following operators,

- addition: `a + b`,

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print(40 + 2)
</script></pre></div>

- substraction `a - b`,

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print(45 - 3)
</script></pre></div>

- multiplication `a * b`,

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print(21 * 2)
</script></pre></div>

- and division `a / b` operators.

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print(294 / 7)
</script></pre></div>

In addition to these, Python also has *integer division* and modulo operators,

- floor or integer division: `a // b`, divides `a` by `b` then returns integer
part of the quotient (rounds down the result to the nearest whole number),

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print(294 // 7)
</script></pre></div>

- modulo: `a % b`, returns the remainder of the division.

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print(85 % 43)
</script></pre></div>

> Try to run the above commands in the  [terminal](/pythonlab/terminal/){:target="_blank"}.
You don't need to use `print` in the terminal to see the output of the command.
Keep the terminal open when reading through the pages of this site to quickly
try out different variations of the commands.
