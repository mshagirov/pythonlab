Like many modern high-level programming languages Python comes with an assortment
of built-in functions and the standard library that provides a vast array of
out-of-the-box features to the "*default Python*".

In this workshop session, we will cover some of the most frequently used features
and functions of the Python Standard Library.

> It is good to keep the official documentation of
[the Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html){:target="_blank"}
handy and to consult it when you are getting yourself familiar with Python.
