Like many modern high-level programming languages Python comes with an assortment
of built-in functions and the standard library that provides a vast array of
out-of-the-box features to the "*default Python*".

> It is good to keep the official documentation of
[the python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html){:target="_blank"}
handy and to consult it when you are getting started with Python.
