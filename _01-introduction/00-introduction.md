Python is a general-purpose programming language used for a wide range of tasks.
Wide range of applications, community support, and simplicity of Python made it
popular among the beginners and the experienced programmers alike.

Python boasts a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and packages that extend
its capabilities for diverse tasks. These tasks (domains) include, but not
limited to,

- web development,
- automation (scripting),
- deep learning and artificial intelligence,
- data analysis,
- scientific computing.

### A Code Example

As an example, let's use Python's `print` function. It takes an input which is
everything inside its enclosing parentheses `(...)`, and prints this out
to the *console*.

- `print(input)` : prints the text representation of the input to the console.

> Console in programming refers to an interface for interacting with a computer
program. E.g., the code cell below.

Generally, it is used to display output of a program. We will use `print`
throughout this workshop to examine and debug our code.

- Run the following code to print a text with `Hello there!` to the console.

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print("Hello there!")
</script></pre></div>

> Hover over the code and click the run button.

### About This Workshop

This workshop session will mainly focus on the Python language and its built-in
features. We will not cover any external modules such as scientific packages and
leave it to the future workshops.

**E1:** Edit the following code to print a greeting by replacing the
question mark `?` with your name. The code should greet you when you
run it.

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print("Hello, ?")
</script></pre></div>

> Feel free to modify the code. If you make a mistake,
just reload the page to reset all code cells on the page.
