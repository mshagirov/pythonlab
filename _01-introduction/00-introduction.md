Python is a general-purpose programming language used for a wide range of tasks.
Wide range of applications, community support, and simplicity of Python made it
popular among the beginners and the experienced programmers alike.

For instance, appeciate the intuitive Python syntax by running the following code
to print `Hello there` to the console.

> Console in programming refers to an interface for interacting with a computer
program. Its usually a text interface, e.g., the
[terminal](/pythonlab/terminal/){:target="_blank"} webapp, and
the code cell below are consoles.

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print("Hello there")
</script></pre></div>

> Hover over and click the run button.

In the code, `print` is a Python command, or more correctly a function, that
takes its input which is everything between the enclosing parentheses,
`(` and `)`, and outputs or *prints it out to the console*.

I will use this type of code cells
throughout the workshop. Feel free to modify the code. If you make a mistake,
just reload the page to reset all code cells on the page.

Now, edit the following code to print a greeting by replacing the
question mark `?` with your name:

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print("Hello, ?")
</script></pre></div>

Python boasts a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and packages that extend
its capabilities for diverse tasks. These tasks (domains) include, but not
limited to,

- web development,
- automation (scripting),
- deep learning and artificial intelligence,
- data analysis,
- scientific computing.

This workshop session will mainly focus on the Python language and its features.
We will cover some of the scientific packages and applications in the coming workshops.
