[Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} is a general-purpose
programming language
used for a wide range of domains. In addition to its versatility,
Python's intuitive syntax is relatively easy to read, and makes it perfect for
beginners as well as efficient for experienced code maintainers. For instance,
you should be able read and guess what the following Python code does when you
run it.

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print("Hello there")
print("General Kenobi")
</script></pre></div>

*Hover over with your mouse and click the run button (green triangle)*. If you
have guessed that this code just prints some lines, then you are correct.

You should see the folliwing lines when you run the above print commands.

```sh
Hello there
General Kenobi
```

In the code, `print` is a Python command, or more correctly a function, that
takes its input which is everything between following `(` and `)` and outputs it
to the *console*.

> Console in programming refers to any interface for interacting with a computer
program. Console is usually a text based interface, e.g., this
[terminal](/pythonlab/terminal/){:target="_blank"} webapp.
All executable code and their output fields on this site are also examples of
console applications.

Now, try to modify the following code to print a greeting by replacing the
question mark `?` with your name:

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><script type="py-editor" worker>
print("Hello ?")
</script></pre></div>

Due to Python's wide adoption, Python boasts a vast ecosystem of
libraries, frameworks, and packages that extend its capabilities for diverse
tasks. These tasks or domains include, but not limited to,

- web development,
- automation (scripting),
- deep learning and artificial intelligence,
- data analysis,
- scientific computing.

This workshop session will mainly focus on the Python language and its features.

> I plan to cover some of the applications such as using the *science stack* in the
coming sessions of this workshop series. Science stack is a loosely defined term
for a collection of packages and libraries generally used for scientific computing.
You will learn more about science stack after we learn basic Python and practice
writing some code.
