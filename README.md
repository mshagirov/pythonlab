# Plan: Python Workshop Series

## Python and its Applications

Python is a general-purpose programming language designed to be used for a wide
range of domains. In addition to its versatility, Python's intuitive syntax is
relatively easy to read, and makes it perfect for beginners as well as efficient
for experienced code maintainers.

Most importantly, due to its wide adoption, Python boasts a vast ecosystem of
libraries, frameworks, and packages that extend its capabilities for diverse
tasks. These tasks or domains include, but not limited to,

- Server-side web development
- Automation (a.k.a., scripting)
- Machine learning and Data analysis
- "Scientific computing".
