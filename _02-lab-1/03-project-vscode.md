### Project Folder Organisation

`workspace/pythonlab/` will house all the projects that you will write in this
and future labs. Inside it, we will create directories for each lab, and each
lab folder will contain all the projects for that given lab.
You are welcome to continue using `workspace` for your future projects.

> I saw this structure from [Lane Wagner (boot.dev)](https://blog.boot.dev/misc/how-i-organize-my-local-development-environment/)
and have adopted it in my own workflow.

### Entry Point for Your Program : `main.py`

- Open `~/workplace/pythonlab/lab1/dna-analyser` as a folder in VS Code.
- Create and open a new python (text) file in the `dna-analyser`. Name the
file `main.py`.

<script src="{{ '/assets/js/tabs.js' | relative_url }}"></script>
<div class="prevnextlinks">
    <a id="previous" href="02">Previous: Part 1</a>
    <a id="next" href="04">Next: Part 3</a>
</div>
<script src="{{ '/assets/js/navigation.js' | relative_url }}" defer></script>
